    ```

2. Create a `config.js` file in the `backend/src` directory and add the following:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
        emailUser: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
        emailPassword: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
        mongodbUri: process.env.MONGODB_URI
    };
    ```

### Frontend
